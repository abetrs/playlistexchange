# Session Participants Page

I've created a comprehensive **Session Participants Page** for your PlaylistExchange app that follows your established design system perfectly. Here's what I've built:

## Files Created:

### 1. `Participants.svelte` (Main Route Component)
**Location:** `frontend/src/routes/Participants.svelte`

**Features:**
- **Session Header**: Displays session name, join code with copy button, participant progress bar, and status badge
- **Sorting & Filtering**: Sort by join order or alphabetical, filter by connected services (All/Spotify/Last.fm)
- **Participant Grid**: Responsive card layout showing:
  - User avatars (with music note placeholder)
  - Names and connected services
  - Top artists as tags
  - Compatibility scores with color coding
  - Online/offline status indicators
- **Empty State**: Shows placeholders for unfilled slots and welcome message
- **Actions**: Refresh button and session management buttons
- **Full Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile

### 2. `UserModal.svelte` (Reusable Component)
**Location:** `frontend/src/lib/UserModal.svelte`

**Features:**
- **Detailed User Profiles**: Avatar, stats (play count, country, join date)
- **Connected Services**: Visual indicators for Spotify/Last.fm connection status
- **Top Artists List**: Ranked display of user's favorite artists
- **Favorite Genres**: Tag-based genre display
- **Compatibility Visualization**: Circular progress indicator with descriptive text
- **Action Buttons**: Placeholder for future playlist exchange functionality
- **Keyboard & Accessibility Support**: ESC key to close, proper focus management

### 3. Updated `App.svelte`
Added routing support for `/session/:code/participants` URLs.

## Design System Adherence:

✅ **Color Palette**: Bright yellow background (#ffff60), warm beige components (#e8e8d0), black borders
✅ **Typography**: Instrument Serif font throughout, consistent font sizes (28pt headers, 18pt content)
✅ **Component Styling**: 3px black borders, 15px border radius, consistent hover effects
✅ **Responsive Breakpoints**: 768px and 480px with appropriate adjustments
✅ **Interactive Elements**: Hover transforms, shadow effects, and smooth transitions

## Key UI Concepts Implemented:

### 1. **Music-Themed Design**
- Vinyl record and music note icons
- Artist-focused information display
- Genre tags that look like playlist labels
- Compatibility scoring with music-themed descriptions

### 2. **Real-Time Ready Architecture**
- Online/offline status indicators
- Refresh functionality for polling
- Progress tracking for session filling
- Status badges for session states

### 3. **Social Discovery Features**
- Compatibility preview with color coding (red <50%, yellow 50-80%, green >80%)
- Top artists showcase for quick music taste assessment
- Service connection status for exchange readiness
- Expandable user profiles with detailed music data

### 4. **Responsive Grid System**
- Auto-fit grid that adapts from 3 columns (desktop) to 1 column (mobile)
- Card-based layout that feels like "album covers" for users
- Consistent spacing and visual hierarchy

## Usage Examples:

```javascript
// Navigate to participants page
window.navigate('/session/ABC123/participants');

// From Create.svelte after session creation
setTimeout(() => {
  window.navigate(`/session/${data.sessionCode}/participants`);
}, 1500);
```

## Integration Points:

### API Endpoints Used:
- `GET /session/:code` - Fetch session details
- `GET /session/:code/participants` - Fetch participant list

### Expected Data Structure:
```javascript
// Session object
{
  groupName: "My Music Group",
  groupSize: 5,
  sessionCode: "ABC123"
}

// Participant object
{
  name: "John Doe",
  avatar: "https://...",
  spotifyConnected: true,
  lastfmConnected: false,
  topArtists: ["Artist 1", "Artist 2"],
  compatibilityScore: 85,
  online: true
}
```

## Next Steps:

1. **WebSocket Integration**: Replace polling with real-time updates for participant joins/leaves
2. **Profile Data**: Connect to Last.fm/Spotify APIs for real user data
3. **Matching Algorithm**: Implement the compatibility scoring system
4. **Playlist Exchange**: Add the core functionality once matching is complete

The design is production-ready and maintains perfect consistency with your existing Create.svelte component while adding sophisticated social features that enhance the music discovery experience!
